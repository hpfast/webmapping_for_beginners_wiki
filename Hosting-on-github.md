:arrow_forward: Head over to GitHub.com and create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) named `myfirstwebmap`

![](img/create_repro.png)

:arrow_forward: Give your repository a nice description. Like:

	My First Web Map in Leaflet.js

:arrow_forward: Setting: `Public`

:arrow_forward: Initialize this repository with a README.md

:arrow_forward: Create Repository

Now we have our own repository!

### Uploading files

:arrow_forward:. Upload all the files you need for your web map. Choose either the Leaflet or the D3 map. We can only show 1 per repository. Repeat these steps if you want to show both! 

- index.html
- main.css
- main.js
- data.geojson

### Hosting with GitHub-Pages

GitHub has this awesome trick! If we change our main branch to a GitHub Pages branch and put a `index.html` file in there, GitHub will host our website!

:arrow_forward: Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.

:arrow_forward: Then select the master branch source and click on the Save button.

![GitHub Pages Source Setting](img/source-setting.png)

Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io/repository.
Change the user-name in the link to your own GitHub user name and the repository to your repository name! Note that every time you make changes, you may need to wait a minute before Github Pages picks up the changes.

Read more about it here:  https://pages.github.com/

### Editing the README.md

The README contains the text that is shown at the bottom of your repository. This usually contains a small explanation of what the repository is about and links to useful other sources.
Let's edit our README.md in the browser to customize it! 

:arrow_forward: Click on the README.md file and edit it by clicking the edit button.

:arrow_forward: In the README.md put the following:

	~~~
	# My First Web Map in Leaflet.js

	This repository contains the scripts and data for my first interactive web map.

	You can view my map <[HERE](http://username.github.io/repository)>
	~~~

:arrow_forward: Change the user-name in the link to your own GitHub user name and the repository to your repository name! 

:arrow_forward: Commit changes. 

### Now send the link to all your family and friends!
